## **v2.1 - Local Parity & Production Simulation** 📋 (Date: TBD - SHA: TBD - v2.1-fix-dev-add-prodparity)

- 📋 Unified naming taxonomy across environments (`vendure-db`, `vendure-server`, `vendure-worker`, `vendure-storefront`, `vendure-network`)
- 📋 Standardized PostgreSQL version (Postgres 17) across local & production
- 📋 Restored local development stability after drift from production
- 📋 Introduced **production simulation mode** (prod-sim Docker Compose)
- 📋 Clearly separated development ergonomics from production correctness

### Environment Modes Introduced

| Mode       | Purpose                                                        |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| local      | Developer ergonomics (hot reload, bind mounts, fast iteration) |
| prod-sim   | Production parity validation (real build, real topology)       |
| production | Live deployment on server                                      |

### Why This Matters

Local development is optimized for **speed and iteration**.

Production simulation is optimized for **correctness and parity**.

- Dev answers: _“Does my code change work?”_
- Prod-sim answers: _“Will this behave correctly in production?”_

v2.1 strengthens deployment confidence before v3 hardening and payment activation.

It does not add new business functionality — it hardens the foundation.

```bash
git tag -a v2.1-fix-dev-add-prodparity -m "Fix local env & add production simulation parity"
git push origin v2.1-fix-dev-add-prodparity
```
